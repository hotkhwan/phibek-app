# Architecture Review Workflow

This repository uses a plan-review-implement workflow for cross-repo changes.

## Roles

### Claude

Claude is the primary planner and implementer.

Responsibilities:
- analyze current state and cross-repo impact
- create or update `docs/plan/<name>.md`
- create or update `docs/contracts/<name>.md` or `openapi/<name>.yaml`
- revise the plan based on review feedback
- implement only after the plan is ready
- validate and test after implementation

### Codex

Codex acts as architecture manager and review gate before implementation.

Responsibilities:
- review the plan and contract before implementation starts
- identify architecture drift, contract gaps, rollout risks, and missing validation
- force clarification on ownership, system-of-record, sync authority, and compatibility
- return blocking issues and high-risk assumptions when the plan is not ready
- approve the plan when it is good enough to implement and validate

Target quality bar:
- the plan does not need to be perfect
- the plan should be at least 80% ready before implementation starts

## Standard Context

These defaults apply unless the plan explicitly justifies an override.

- Feature owner backend: default = `klynx-api`
- Events system of record: `gateway-api`
- Kafka topic for normalized events: `gw.events.normalized.v1`
- Event producer: `gateway-api`
- Event consumer: `klynx-api`
- Device/camera identity and sync state source of truth: `gateway-api/device_management`
- `klynx/camera` is a projection and consumer model for Klynx workflows
- Frontend must follow documented contracts and must not invent API, request/response, error, or event schemas

## Cross-Repo Paths

- BE1 (`klynx-api`): `/home/klynx/klynx-api-feature`
- BE2 (`gateway-api`): `/home/phibek/gateway-api`
- FE1 (`KLynx-Platform`): `/home/klynx/klynx-feature`
- FE2 (`gateway-Platform`): `/home/phibek/gateway-portal`

## Required Workflow

### 1. Plan First

For any feature, bug, flow change, event change, sync change, deploy change, or cross-repo work:

- do not implement first
- create or update the plan artifact in `docs/plan/`
- create or update the shared contract artifact in `docs/contracts/` when API, event, sync, or FE integration is affected

### 2. Review Before Implementation

Codex reviews:
- architecture direction
- feature owner
- domain system of record
- producer / consumer / topic mapping
- canonical store / projection store
- request / response / error contract
- sync ownership, field ownership, write authority, idempotency
- cross-repo rollout order
- scope, risks, rollback, validation, testing

If the plan is not ready, the verdict must be:

`Plan requires revision before implementation.`

If the plan is ready, the verdict must be:

`Plan is ready for Claude to implement and validate.`

### 3. Revise Until Ready

Claude revises the plan and contract using Codex feedback until the review gate is clear.

### 4. Implement After Approval

Implementation order:
1. owner backend first
2. upstream or peer backend changes next
3. update contract/docs to match actual implementation
4. FE changes after backend contract is stable
5. validate and test

### 5. Branch flow (batch model)

ดู `CLAUDE.md` §"Branch flow (batch model — small team, 1–2 BE devs)" ซึ่งเป็น authoritative diagram. สรุปสำหรับ Codex review:

```
feature  →merge→  develop  (UAT 1-2 hr; Jenkins → ArgoCD → dev)  →merge→  main (prod)
```

- **`feature` เป็น batch branch** — dev commit ตรงได้, ไม่มี per-commit PR review gate. การ merge feature → develop คือ checkpoint
- **`develop` = UAT lane** — Jenkins build + image push + ArgoCD sync, user UAT 1-2 hr per batch
- **`main` = production** — merge จาก develop หรือ `release/develop-to-main` เท่านั้น
- **PR-gated exceptions** (cross-repo plans, breaking changes, scope ที่ต้องผ่าน Codex review): ใช้ per-task branch จาก develop → PR เข้า develop
- Jenkins commits (`chore(cd): update go-aliza image tag ...`) เป็น CI artifact — ไม่ต้อง review
- ห้าม commit ตรงบน `develop` หรือ `main` (merge targets only)

Codex review focus:
- PR → `develop` (per-task exception): contract correctness, UAT plan, version bump, plan/contract artifacts
- PR → `main` (release rotation): batch consistency, deploy risk, env/migration ordering — ไม่ re-review เนื้อหารายตัว
- Direct feature commits (batch flow): review เกิดตอน feature → develop merge ไม่ใช่ per commit

### 6. Cross-repo coordination (option 2: multi-session, hub-and-spoke)

ดู `CLAUDE.md` §"Cross-repo coordination (multi-session, hub-and-spoke)" — authoritative.

```
klynx-api (HUB: plan + contract)
   │
   ├─→ gateway-api (BE2 spoke: events + device_management SoT)
   ├─→ klynx-feature (FE1 spoke: klynx UI)
   └─→ gateway-portal (FE2 spoke: gateway admin)
```

Codex review focus per repo:

- **`klynx-api` PR (hub)**: contract authority correctness, plan completeness, BE1 implementation matches contract, version bump, `docs/plan/done/` move + `docs/plan/platform-roadmap.md` update at close-out
- **`gateway-api` PR (spoke)**: implementation matches the contract `klynx-api` published — no contract drift, BE2-side validation/migrations align with the rollout order, events / device_management ownership rules unchanged
- **`klynx-feature` PR (FE1 spoke)**: consumes `klynx-api` contract, no schema invention, error handling matches documented codes (incl. `details.cause` discriminators), no header dependencies the contract didn't promise
- **`gateway-portal` PR (FE2 spoke)**: consumes the relevant contract (`klynx-api/docs/contracts/` for klynx-side, `gateway-api/docs/contracts/` for gw-specific), no schema invention

Cross-repo plan review checklist (in addition to §"Minimum Plan Contents"):

1. Plan declares feature owner backend explicitly (default `klynx-api`)
2. Contract under `klynx-api/docs/contracts/<name>.md` covers all consumers (BE2 + FEs)
3. Order of work specified (`klynx-api` → BE2 → FEs)
4. Each spoke repo's PR cites the canonical contract artifact path
5. Telegram coordination plan present — who posts UAT-ready signal, who acks before main rotation

Sync channels:
- **Contract files** = canonical async (`klynx-api/docs/contracts/<name>.md`)
- **Telegram MCP** (`@alizaLite_bot` via `~/.claude/mcp.json`) = real-time status / blocker / approval handshake — **NOT a decision log**
- Decisions go in plan + contract artifacts under `klynx-api/docs/`

When reviewing a PR that claims cross-repo coordination, Codex should verify that the contract change (if any) shipped first under `klynx-api`, and that this PR consumes from the canonical artifact rather than a copy. Flag drift between the spoke implementation and the hub contract as a blocker.

## Time Budget — speed guardrail

Every task — plan + review + implement + build + test + commit + PR — should close within **about 1 hour total**. This is a speed guardrail for fast delivery, not a reason to fragment cohesive work. Bundle related changes when they can be finished and validated inside the window; split only when the combined scope would slow delivery or blur validation.

### Codex review pacing

- **Rev limit: 2.** First review + one revision must clear the gate. Hitting rev 3 = the plan is the wrong size; verdict should ask Claude to **split or downgrade**, not loop another review round.
- **80% bar holds.** When a plan is at 80% ready, approve and let implementation surface the remaining 10% as follow-up tasks. Don't gate-keep on issues that an in-flight implementation can resolve cheaper than another revision round.
- **Blockers vs. notes.** If a finding would take Claude > 30 min to address, mark it as **follow-up task**, not a revision blocker. Use blockers only for things that genuinely break the plan.

### Claude review pacing

- **Self-review batches at end.** Build + test once after implementation, not after every edit.
- **Don't loop on micro-fixes.** Collect issues, fix in one batch, re-test once.
- **Blockers > 30 min spawn a new task.** Close the current task with what shipped; file the rest.

### Slowdown signals (stop and re-scope)

- Codex rev 3+
- Session > 1 hour
- Plan stretches across days or sessions
- Same scope getting reopened with new findings each round

When any signal fires: **stop**, surface to the user, re-scope or escalate. Don't silently burn down the iteration.

## Review Rules

### Feature Ownership

- feature owner backend must be declared for every cross-repo change
- if the owner is not `klynx-api`, the plan must explain why

### System of Record

- system of record must be declared per domain
- do not collapse ownership into one global statement

Required defaults:
- events canonical detail: `gateway-api`
- Klynx event projection: `klynx-api/event_refs`
- device/camera identity and sync state: `gateway-api/device_management`
- Klynx camera data: projection for Klynx workflows

### Event Flow

If the change touches events, the plan and contract must state:
- topic names
- producers
- consumers
- canonical store
- projection store
- replay or re-sync behavior
- idempotency or duplicate handling

### Device/Camera Sync

If the change touches device/camera sync, the plan and contract must state:
- write authority
- field ownership
- allowed initiators
- conflict resolution
- echo-loop prevention when relevant

The safe default is:
- Klynx may initiate change
- `gateway-api/device_management` persists first
- downstream sync updates Klynx projection afterward

### Frontend Contract Rule

- frontend must not guess schema
- frontend should implement only against the shared backend contract
- the plan must contain enough detail that FE1 and FE2 can implement without reverse-engineering backend code

## Minimum Plan Contents

Every cross-repo plan should contain:
- scope
- current state
- ownership model
- contract summary
- field ownership and sync rules when applicable
- cross-repo impact
- rollout order
- rollback strategy
- decision points
- validation checklist

Use `docs/plan/TEMPLATE.md`.
